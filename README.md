# Cost-Prediction-ML
We were able to identify key drivers of cost, such as fluctuations in raw material prices and energy consumption. We developed a cost prediction model that provided accurate cost estimates for different production scenarios.
There are 3 variations of the project. app.py files are the UI representation of the project.
